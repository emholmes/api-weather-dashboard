# Weather Dashboard
## Server-Side APIs Challenge

This repo contains the code for a weather dashboard. This challenge assignment displays my knowledge and ability to use server-side APIs, along with Javascript to manipulate HTML and CSS. 

This dashboard shows the current weather for a searched city, along with a 5-Day forecast.
The seach history is saved as buttons under the search input. Clicking a search history button will show up-to-date weather information. As the search history grows, the area will turn scrollable at the set max-height. The user can also hover over the weather icons and see the icons description. The icons also contain alt text for screen readers.
